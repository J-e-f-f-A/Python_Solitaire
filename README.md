Python_Solitaire_VT100
======================

Solitaire game in Python for VT100 terminal (Learning Python)

I wrote this program while learing Python.  It is based on a Solitaire game I wrote in TACL in ~1994, 
which ran on a Tandem system and a Text 6530/6526 Terminal.

I am now going to update this program to use the Graphics library to have a Graphical display. ;-) 

(See Python_Solitaire_Graphical_v1 once I get started)

(test update via update on PC, then commited to GIT)
